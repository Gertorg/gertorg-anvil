If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be {@condition frightened} of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the {@condition frightened} creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.",
